1.  **Data Ingestion (ADF Pipeline)**:
    
    -   Set up Azure Data Factory (ADF) to create pipelines for ingesting data from the on-premises SQL Server Database.
    -   Configure the ADF pipeline to push data to the Bronze container in ADLS Gen2.
    
2.  **Data Transformation (Databricks)**:
    
    -   Utilize Azure Databricks for data transformation tasks.
    -   Create Databricks notebooks or Spark jobs to clean and transform data from the Bronze container.
    -   Implement data quality checks and error handling mechanisms during the transformation process.
    -   Load the cleaned data into the Silver container in ADLS Gen2.
3.  **Further Cleaning and Processing (Databricks)**:
    
    -   Implement additional cleaning and processing steps in Databricks to refine the data further.
    -   Apply transformations such as deduplication, normalization, or feature engineering as required.
    -   Load the processed data into the Gold container in ADLS Gen2.
4.  **Data Warehousing (Azure Synapse Analytics)**:
    
    -   Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics to create a dedicated SQL database for analytics purposes.
    -   Establish a connection between Azure Synapse Analytics and ADLS Gen2 to access data stored in the Gold container.
    -   Design and implement schemas within the SQL database to accommodate the structured data from the Gold container.
5.  **Reporting and Visualization (Power BI)**:
    
    -   Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics SQL database to access the clean data for reporting.
    -   Develop interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize key metrics and insights.
    -   Implement data refresh schedules in Power BI to ensure that reports reflect the most recent data from Azure Synapse Analytics.

By planning your project architecture in detail, you'll be able to effectively implement each component and ensure a smooth flow of data from ingestion to visualization. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific aspect of this architecture!
